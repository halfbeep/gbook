get books and review 

Hi Daryl

you can see the idea of how I'd approach this problem. It's far from prod done and actually if I was writing this commercially I'd use typeScript, re-define the book objects on response using a type checked interface' and some of the functions could be inline callbacks too. Many thanks

All the best, see you soon hopefully

Shaun
